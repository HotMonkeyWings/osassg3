In order to compile,

run gcc -o Mark Marks.c && gcc -o Stud Studs.c

To run it,

run ./Mark and ./Stud

After which, follow along with instructions in the program.

The students and TA are run by nested fork calls, hence they are all different processes.
The students cannot read other students' grades but the TA receives all of them.

A message is then sent back after computing the grades to the CI from the TA.
